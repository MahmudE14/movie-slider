# Movie Slider
A slider component that fetches the movie data from the `The Movie Database (TMDB)` and renders them accordingly. The component uses API based pagination and applies a fallback render animation for clients with slower network.

## Installation instruction
In the project directory, run the following command:
```
>> npm install
>> npm start
```


### Note
After running `npm start`, default browser should be opened following the link by default. If it doesn't start by default, follow the link provided in the CLI. In most cases it should be `http://localhost:3000/`. But looking into the CLI would be better.
